	<p>If I'm gonna be completely honest, I've got nothing to show for myself lol. I'm just some dude on the internet who likes to draw funny pictures on MS Paint, so I don't know what you want from me.</p>
	<p>Favorite music mainly consists of random stuff. I like Tatsuro Yamashita, so I guess I have that going for me.</p>
	<p>Oh yeah, here's a face reveal.</p>
